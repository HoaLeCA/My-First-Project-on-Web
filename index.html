                    reuse or repurposing means that new material sources must be found and refined… and the Earth has only

                <p> The deepest mine on Earth - the Mponeng digging in South Africa - penetrates less than 4km below the
                    surface.
                    At that depth, the rock sizzles at 60°C, as workers sweat and scramble to extract gold from a single
                    seam
                    less than a meter wide. Meanwhile, untold wealth is orbiting in the sky, far above our heads.</p>

                        The fundamental elements of the Universe - hydrogen and helium - were formed
                        during the Big Bang. Drawn together, these elements form stars, where almost every other atomic
                        structure is cooked into existence. When these suns explode as supernova, their structure is ejected
                        into the galaxy at close to the speed of light. Over billions of years, drawn together by
                        gravitational
                        perturbation, particles from different suns collect and clump together. Gravity and spin do the
                        rest,
                        forming new stars and planets - heavy, mineral-rich rocky bodies, gas giants, and icy worldlets -
                        and
                        eventually, you: the iron in your blood, the calcium in your teeth, were all formed in the hearts of
                        stars.

                    This process is not perfect: floating between the planets are billions of half-formed structures, the
                    leftover and discarded remnants of the solar system. These asteroids contain the raw ingredients of the
                    cosmic construction process; in our local solar system, they are classified by both composition and
                    distance. The metallic-bearing asteroids, known as <span class="p1">M-types,</span> are the third most
                    populous type, and there are
                    millions of them.

                        Some of these bodies are <span class="p1">huge</span> : one of the largest, 511 Davida, is 270 ~ 310
                        kilometres in diameter, and
                        50 sextillion kilos in mass, much of it nickel and iron. If it could be retrieved and mined, the
                        asteroid’s ore would be worth over 100 <span class="p1">trillion</span> dollars on today’s market.
                        Another, 16 Psyche, is
                        thought to be the shattered iron core of a protoplanet.

                        Of course, the mass and composition of an asteroid is not the only determinate of how profitable it
                        might be. The body’s orbit is also important - Davida is more than three times the Earth’s distance
                        from
                        the sun, for example - and the technology required to mine in zero gravity has yet to be developed.

                        much
                        less asteroids.

                    However, asteroids are not the only source of wealth near the Earth: the Moon has been collecting
                    Helium-3 on its surface from the sun’s solar wind for billions of years, which could be used to power
                    fusion reactors. Comets can provide water, methane, and other chemicals.

            <h3>Mining Concerns</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Today, several companies are seriously looking at mining near-Earth asteroids, including <b><a

                        Resources</a></b>, Deep Space Resources, and Asteroid Mining Corporation. Technological development
                    continues, with the hope that it outpaces the exhaustion of Earth’s diminishing natural resources.
